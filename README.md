## Introduction

Welcome to Cable, our Secure Decentralized Messaging Platform project, developed as part of the Shellhacks 2023 hackathon in Miami, FL. This platform is designed to provide a secure and open-source alternative to a certain purple gaming social media messaging platform. Our goal is to create a decentralized and privacy-focused messaging system that gives users full control over their data and the communities they create.

## Features

- **Decentralized Messaging**: No central server stores your messages, ensuring greater privacy and security.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted, ensuring only the intended recipient can read them.
- **Open Source**: We believe in transparency and open source principles.
- **Cross-Platform**: Our platform is currently accessible only PC, but can work with both iOS and Android platforms, using Flutter for the frontend.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication to protect your account.
- **Direct Interactions**: Create and manage 1-on-1 chats with your friends and colleagues.
- **Message History**: Access your message history anytime, anywhere.

## Technologies

- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot
  - Java
  - MySQL Database
  
- **Frontend**:
